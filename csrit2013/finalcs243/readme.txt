Basically for this, i took the bottom down approach in order to implement this project. I thought that it would be pratical
to implement interval commands before external commands because they were more trivial. After the implmentation of this i implemented
the external part which required a process within our program which was accomplished with the fork command. I then added the output features in order
to show the history as well as the verbose being on output. I freed memory of all parts and as a result this caused no memory leaks to be found
